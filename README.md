# SSL-SEVIT

This repository contains the source code developed as part of my **Master of Science (Information Technology)** research project: **Self-supervised Squeeze-and-Excitation Fast Vision Transformer for Medical Image Classification**.

The work focuses on the design, implementation, and evaluation of deep learning models proposed in the dissertation.

Due to GitHub file size limitations, the fine-tuned model weights (`.pth` files) are **not stored directly in this repository** and are instead shared via an external Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1geUc6Jz8ge98IGUZOhhyFTiKS4cAtfch?usp=sharing

Datasets used in my research:

1. **SARS-COV-2 Ct-Scan Dataset**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/plameneduardo/sarscov2-ctscan-dataset
2. **Brain Tumor MRI Dataset**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset
3. **Tuberculosis (TB) Chest X-ray Dataset**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/scipygaurav/tuberculosis-tb-chest-x-ray-cleaned-database
